My contributions range from numerical methods to a variety of statistical analysis.\n\nI’m an individual who enjoys making a difference at the technical level but also as a group member. I believe that developing valuable tools and insights is an iterative and collaborative process.\nI’m also interested in computational methods to analyze Multiplexed Immunofluorescence image data. Specifically, I’m interested in spatial methods to draw insights from point-process patterns.\n\n Download my cv.\n\n\n\n\n\n Senior Analytics Engineer | Jan 2021 - Present  Occidental Petroleum  Houston, TX\n Mathematical Scientist | Sep 2016 - Jan 2021  Occidental Petroleum  Houston, TX\n Assistant Professor | Sep 2016 - Jan 2021  Mercy College of Health Sciences  Des Moines, IA\n Graduate Teaching Assistant | Aug 2010 – May 2015  Iowa State University  Ames, IA\n\n\n\n PhD in Applied Mathematics | 2010 - 2015  Iowa State University\n BS in Mathematics | 2006 - 2009  University of Texas Pan-American\n\n\n\n Mathematics, Statistics, Programming\n Tennis, Birds, Music, Fishing"
