I was a little bit bored and while looking looking around youtube I came across a 2020 MIT series on _Introduction to Algorithms_. The first lecture is pretty basic but the second one features one of my favorite MIT online course intructors: Erik Demaine. So I decided to just type his second lecture on Data Structures using Quarto for practice.

First thing is to distinguish between an Application Program Interface (API) and a Data Structure

:::{.callout}
**API**: Tells you **what** you want to do.

:::{.callout}
**Data Structure** : Tells you **how** you do it.
